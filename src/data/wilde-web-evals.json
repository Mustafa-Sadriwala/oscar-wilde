        "content": "The Wilde-related website I have selected to analyze is oscarwildeinamerica.org. This website was created by John Cooper, a documentary historian and Oscar Wilde scholar. For the past 20 years he has specialized his research on Oscar Wilde’s time in New York. Both the website’s content and web design were completed by Cooper. While the website does not state the last time it was edited, it was last copywritten to John Cooper in 2020. The most recent blog post linked to the site was published November 1, 2020, meaning it is relatively well-maintained and updated.\n\tAccording to Cooper, this website “has been used by scholars, institutions, and the media around the world and is the largest online resource on the life and times of Oscar Wilde in America.” It is noncommercial and freely provided to further spread the private study Cooper has done the past 30 years. The website contains no advertisements and was created without funding. Cooper’s goal is to make the life of Oscar Wilde and his time in America more accessible for more people.\n\tIn terms of the website’s structure, it has mainly a utilitarian function. However, each page contains several pictures, so on a scale of 10, I would rank it a 4. The main page contains a short blurb about Oscar Wilde’s time in America, links to selected content on the website, and a short blurb about the author of the website. Aesthetically, Cooper has included pictures of Wilde as well as a quote. The website displays a banner at the top of every page which can be used to navigate among the pages. There are seven categories included on this banner to help organize all of the content. This banner allows for some inherent symmetry, but the rest of the page is more freeform. While freeform, the pages do not seem overly cluttered or difficult to read.\n\tOne of the main aesthetic things that Cooper has included is an abundance of photographs. The images included in both the “Photographs” section as well as the other pages are interesting and relevant to the content being discussed. They make the content more engaging and help put a face to the author. The website uses full sentences, and content is sectioned by paragraphs. The writing is formal but is easy to read and digest.\n\tOverall, I believe the website achieves its goals. It is easy to navigate and read while providing lots of information about Oscar Wilde and his time in America. While the research provided was done privately, and thus no sources are provided, the information is varied and in-depth. I believe one of the main improvements to this website would be the inclusion of sources. I personally do not care for the font Cooper uses for headings and titles, but it does add to the creativity and aesthetic of the website. This website would be an excellent resource for people interested in learning about Oscar Wilde, his views on the United States, as well as how his time there impacted him as an author.\n"

        "content": "The website https:\/\/www.biography.com\/writer\/oscar-wilde, is sponsored by A&E Television Networks, LLC. The page was last updated on October 10, 2019. The Oscar Wilde page appears to be trying to inform the reader about the life of Oscar Wilde, and it appears to be aimed at anyone who might be interested in learning about Wilde and his biography. The website in general appears to be trying to inform anyone about the biographies of any kind of famous person like a musician, athlete, media figure, or celebrity, as well as just any kind of information that appears to be relevant in the world and history. The website does have a few ads here and there, but there is not an exaggerated amount of them. It is fairly well organized, the information on the page about Oscar Wilde is separated into different sections representing different phases of his life. Each section has a title that indicates what that section of information will be about. From a scale of 1-10, this website would probably be a 5, because it is very functional and appears to do a good job in giving the reader organized information about the life and work of Oscar Wilde or any other person the visitor wants to learn about, but it is not most aesthetically pleasing website, it is very simple and to the point, and does the job. The very top of the main page has different topics listed, which you can click on to get more information on that topic. Underneath the list of main topics is a big image, which corresponds with what I assume is the article of the day or week and scrolling down there are four images of some well-known people, which you can click on to read more about. Underneath the images there is a small description of who the person in the image is. Scrolling down some more there is a section labeled “People” and there are more images of well-known individuals that also have the descriptions of who they are. Lastly, on the main page there is a section labeled “Archives” that has many articles on the main topics of the website like nostalgia, celebrity, and history & culture. I believe the main page does have a high degree of symmetry. All of the images on the website look appealing and interesting, they also appear to be of high quality, they don’t look blurry or of bad quality. The website appears to only have expository and narrative writing, because it is setting forth facts and telling people’s stories. My overall evaluation of the site is that it does achieve its goal of being informational about people’s biographies and other topics. I believe it could be improved by reducing the number of ads, so it could be a bit more aesthetically pleasing."

        "content": "The website poetryfoundation.org is sponsored by The Poetry Foundation, which is a non-profit organization committed to promoting poetry as a part of today’s culture. While there is no indication of when the Oscar Wilde page in particular was last updated, the site itself was last updated sometime this month, as the front page refers to a February 2021 issue of Poetry magazine. The site is aimed at a general audience, as its goal is to promote, celebrate, and present poetry; the site even includes sections for poems suitable for children and teens. That being said, its primary audience is likely adult readers of poetry. There are no advertisements on the website, though there are links to donate to The Poetry Foundation and to subscribe to Poetry magazine (these links, however, are unobtrusive). The site is easy to look at and relatively pleasing to the eye, featuring only a few simple colors and a few professional fonts. The site is also very easy to navigate and functions very well. I’d put the site between a 5 and 6 (perhaps a bit closer to a 5) as it strikes a fairly clean balance between aesthetics and functionality. The page primarily consists of a single column of text, save for the website’s header, a short column for additional information and related links, and a picture. With features like these, its fairly symmetrical, though the primary column of text has a slight bit of asymmetry due to the presence of the aforementioned shorter column. There is a single image of Wilde at the top. The image is pleasant to look at and, being of Wilde himself, is obviously relevant. The writing itself is both expository and persuasive, outlining Wilde’s personal life and literary career while also critically evaluating his work and providing opinions from other notable sources. \nThe question of whether this page achieves the site’s goals is interesting; while it certainly praises many of Wilde’s works, it remains fairly harsh towards some of his poetry and only provides access to one of his poems. It functions well as a resource for learning about Wilde and his work, but it doesn’t seem to promote his poetry, which would contradict the site’s primary goal. However, this can be explained by the fact that The Poetry Foundation wishes to display “the best poetry,” which seems to imply that Wilde’s other poems are not up to their standards. Taking both their aim and the critical reception of Wilde’s other poetry into account, I would say that the website achieves its stated aim; it has presented and celebrated the best poem that Oscar Wilde has to offer. I would argue, however, that it would be improved by including additional poems of Wilde’s; while they may not be of the same quality as The Ballad of Reading Gaol, the site refers to them, and it would be beneficial to be able to access them for reference. In addition, the page may benefit from a few additional pictures to help break up the monotony of the single column of text, thus helping to keep a reader’s interest.\n"

        "slug": "juhi-karnalkar-cmg-worldwide",
        "content": "Upon opening the webpage, the CMG WW page for Oscar Wilde is aesthetically pleasing. It’s layout has an asymmetrical design, and the first vertical third encompasses a menu for info. The rest of the website is covered by a rotating selection of pictures of Oscar Wilde himself. Because of this, images on the main page and the photos page are obviously relevant, and the signature and accompanying quotes on a few of the pictures are a nice stylistic touch. There are some images on the biography page and page showcasing works, and these are used purely for relevancy and to break up blocks of text. The color scheme is very achromatic. It only uses black, white, gray, and pops of red. The font used throughout the website seems to be in Arial.\nThe website is simple and only has a few pages in the menu, but the modern design makes it easy to use and navigate. On a scale of 1-10 for pure utility vs pure aesthetics, I might rank it at a 7.\nThe site is sponsored by CMG Worldwide, a consulting company which serves as a representative for celebrity estates. Given that CMG hosts websites for other well known and historical individuals, the main purpose of this website seems to be for representing Wilde’s estate and intellectual property. The “About” page has info on licensing media, possibly for images and quotes of Oscar Wilde. The information on Oscar Wilde is not extensive, but showcases the major parts of his life and works. I’d say this site is aimed less for historical research, and more for media licensing purposes.\nThere is no advertising on any of the pages. I cannot find when this site was most recently updated.\nAll of the pages on the website aside from “Home” and “About” are “Biography”, “Works”, “Career”, “Photos”, and “Quotes”. “Biography” and “Career” give a good summary of Wilde’s life and history, but do not direct readers to other sources. “Works” presents all of Wilde’s written works in a timeline. “Quotes” has a selection of popular Wilde quotes separated by categories, such as “Quotes About Men” or “Quotes About Women”.\nOverall, the site has a corporate feel. It is very organized, but the disclaimer from CMG at the bottom is ever-present, reminding one that this site is owned by a consulting company, and not a historian or literature enthusiast. The site does achieve its goals, as it’s simple to navigate, has a decent amount of info on Wilde, and it is easy to contact a representative if one has more questions. There are no obvious mistakes on the website, but more information and sources would add a lot."

        "content": "The website famous-trials.com\/wilde is powered by the University of Missouri-Kansas City (UMKC) School of Law and written by Professor Douglas O. Linder. It is unclear when the site was last updated, but the copyright is maintained to 2021 from 1995. The website targets researchers looking into the three trials of Oscar Wilde and England’s laws on homosexuality. It hosts a wealth of information such as images, clips from movie depictions of the trail, writings and letters from the time concerning the trials, and links to other websites that may be of use when researching the subject.\nThere are no advertisements or pop-ups, making it a clean page with no distractions. But it is too clean and simple, granting it a score of 2 on a scale evaluating the website’s balance of functionality and aesthetic. There is no personality to the website, and it seems to have a default layout and color scheme with an uninteresting font. However, it is easy to navigate and read, so the layout isn’t a hindrance, though it isn’t a plus either. The homepage consists of one dark blue row across the top that leads to the parent webpage (famous-trials.com) and two columns, one with an introduction about the trials and a smaller one to the right with links to additional resources to navigate the pages. A smaller island of white houses the text and sits in the center of a blurry, gray background which lends to a symmetrical layout, but overall, the website has an asymmetrical layout since the main column takes up more space than the one with links, making the body of the page with the readings off-center.\nTo speak more in depth about the content of the website, the images the author chose augment the text with informative captions. Though, they are purely functional, and there’s not many images or icons purely for the look of the website. It’s very drab since the colors are shades of black and white. Therefore, the images are relevant, but the website could benefit from adding more appealing touches like a background and an icon for each page. The website has letters from Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas, transcripts of the trials, and excerpts from reviews concerning the trial as well as the author’s writing on the history and overview of them. There does not seem to be links to the full reviews taken from outside sources though which is very important for citation, so that’s a mark against the website. Looking at all of those elements, famous-trial.com\/wilde is a good initial deeper dive into Wilde’s trials.\nThe website does achieve its goals, but it could improve greatly to garner more viewership if they adopted a more modern look. At the moment, the layout resembles webpages of years past and doesn’t look professional and tech-savvy. It is unremarkable in that regard, so if they updated their design, more people may visit and explore the website as a whole."

        "content": "The site is sponsored by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford DNB). It was last updated October 4th, 2012. It’s purpose is to give us a brief yet detailed account of the who what and when concerning Oscar Wilde spread across seven sections. It is aimed at anyone who wants to know about Oscar Wilde, and anyone who would like to learn more. There are no ads on the page. But, there is an area for subscriber sign in. If you live in Britain, you can sign in with your library card, so the “locked” features can be accessed for free. If not, it seems there are many steps you need to take depending on where you live in the world. Thankfully, many parts of the site are “free”.\nI would give this website a solid 5. It’s not horrendous and super boring to look at. It’s nice and clean- but it’s not very exciting either. At the very top is a nice blue color and navigation tools to access the rest of the site. Concerning the Oscar Wilde specific part, there is only one picture of him at the top. The rest is just text. The utilitarian elements are represented in the sidebar on the left that lets you know which section you are in as you scroll, from which just by clicking a section you can jump to that corresponding section in the text. Asymmetry is present. The main text occupies about 2/3rds of the right side of the screen, while the left 1/3rd is\nfilled with an “article contents” bar. As you scroll down, the article contents bar moves with you. This means you can jump around to different sections with ease. There is only one image of Oscar Wilde. It does the job, but I wish there were just a couple more to spice things up.\nThis site features highly detailed narrative, expository, and descriptive writing. It’s narrative in the sense that it tells the story of Oscar Wilde. From “boyhood and education” to “politics and the theatre: the years of mastery” to “Posthumous reputation”, the site presents information throughout all of Wilde's life (much like a biography). It is expository and descriptive in the sense that many facts are given- in fact, its purpose is to give us facts about Wilde’s life. The text is filled with dates. From the birth and death of Wilde himself (1854-1900) to the births and deaths of every single person mentioned, the writers were very thorough.\nOverall I think it does a great job for what it is. It’s purpose is to take us through Oscar Wilde's life and present us with as many facts as possible: and it does just that. While neat design and aesthetically pleasing pictures are always a plus, I think content should always be more important. Again, a few more visulas would have been nice, but I’d take content over pretty pictures any day.\n"

        "content": "Upon first glance you can almost imagine Dorian Gray and his chums sharing a cocktail or two at the bar at this luxurious restaurant. Located in between Kips Bay and Chelsea (just south of the Empire State Building), OscarWilde NYC is a luxurious restaurant and bar that Wilde himself might even call fabulous.\nLike many restaurants and bars in Manhattan during the pandemic, it has since been shut down; however, they do say this shutdown is temporary. The website makes no notice of it's shut down which one can imply it does not intend to stay this way. \nThe elegant and extravagant interior (and exterior) of the restaurant is posted as you enter the site with the image filling your entire screen. The white text layer above it is soft and thin and placed gently in the top right corner and the center of the page. I would say it's sheer purpose is for guests and travelers seeking elegant and luxury dining to have a glimpse of what is in store for them. \nThe menu tab is short but concise with a separate menu for cocktails, lunch, and dinner. The about section includes a history of the building and a list of the inspiration and artwork on display. The website also includes a brief biography of Oscar Wilde and an informative paragraph of the restaurant's core values. You notice how similarly the values of the restaurant are paired with that of its namesake. \nThe tab that caught my eye was the press tab. Here, I assumed a place where you would find a list of patrons and donors but instead I found reviews from Forbes, the NYT, and The New Yorker all praising the success of the bar/restaurant speaking on both it's elegant interior and aesthetics.\nThe social media handle, @oscarwildenyc, is plugged on every page of the website. They’re social media following is a rather large one with nearly 14-thousand followers. Their instagram is nice in that it optimizes the use of instagram story highlights but the feed itself is a little too far on the meme side of things, or at least, as of late. The restaurant industry is perhaps one of the biggest industries affected in NYC and the proof is here in the pudding. For over 49 weeks the Oscar Wilde NYC has remained shut down. \nAs I mentioned before the website overall is in your face but wasn’t the aesthetic movement also in your face? The image filling the entire screen seems like a technique taken from tumblr but truthfully it works in this situation. Their social media presence is crucial because you can imagine that Oscar Wilde would definitely be the type to post pictures of his food on Instagram.  Overall, I would say it's a well put together restaurant and website paying respectful homage to its namesake. I hope they can get through these tough and trying times.\n"

        "content": "The organization represented on the website, The Oscar Wilde Society, is housed in the United Kingdom, although membership is accepted across the globe. The society itself sponsors the website and is most likely maintained by its many honorary patrons and the society’s honorary president, Gyles Brandreth. The last update for this website was in 2021 as we can see from looking at the copyright at the bottom of the website. \nThis shows how active the Oscar Wilde Society is. The purpose of the website is to expand their organization, promoting membership both in the United Kingdom and internationally as well as participation in events hosted by the society. Unfortunately, due to the Coronavirus, they do not seem to have any events planned for the near future. The only form of advertisement on the site are those that promote their own content, such as their pages on various social media, the publications written by the society and, of course, the benefits of becoming a member. \nI personally believe the website would score a 6 in terms of how it is put together. The website does an amazing job of promoting their own organization, but the aesthetic of the pages do not meet the aesthetically professional standard that many other websites contain. The website mostly contains information relevant to the society, but the website seems more like a personal blog than a website promoting a prestigious organization. All the pages are symmetrical. Most of them have a single column housing a block of text with the intention to inform. The most prominent example being the home page of the site, where they talk briefly about the history of the organization and what the organization is dedicated to. Beneath that, the information then splits into three columns to display the names and pictures of the important figures within the society. This element of organization on the website is also seen on the other informational tags such as the “history” page. The pages that promote contact with the society are structured with more columns, perhaps so that visitors of the website have easy access to content they can interact with without scrolling for ages to find the “payment” button. The images are relevant to the purpose of the society and their website. Images of Oscar Wilde himself are sprinkled throughout the different pages of the website. The images showing the patrons and members of the organization are aesthetically pleasing and paints them in a flattering light as well. However, the header of the website displays three different images of Oscar Wilde, and that is not very appealing. The header is part of the reason why I stated that the website loses some of its professional aesthetic. The three images are low quality and cropped in an odd way that clashes with the teal background of the header. \nThere is little kinds of writing that can be found on the Oscar Wilde Society’s website. As I stated previously, most pages only serve to display information about the society and the society’s purpose. The other prominent kind of writing on the website is that of advertisement. There is one page, however, that displays a timeline of Oscar Wilde’s life. Rather than being a website focused on Oscar Wilde himself, the website focuses on promoting the society online. Overall, the website does an amazing job of portraying the society and what they stand for. \n"

        "website": "https://theculturetrip.com/europe/ireland/articles/15-things-you-may-not-know-about-oscar-wilde/",
        "content": "This website is sponsored by, strangely, a traveling company called Culture Trip. It’s a bit confusing, the fact that they have fifteen random facts about Oscar Wilde when their “About Us” states that Culture Trip is “the essential travel companion to discover and book spot-on stays and experiences, hand-picked by a global community of travel experts and local insiders.” Perhaps their purpose is to interest people in visiting Wilde’s birthplace? After all, it was the first fact listed. Looking at this Wilde’s fun facts page, it’s difficult to find a connection to a company that books travel hotspots. This page was last updated December of 2016, but they don’t cite where their information is from — and I doubt that a travel agent could write this much about Wilde without googling for information.\nThe only advertising on this site is ads for their personal blogs, featuring things like “best European places to go to after coronavirus ends.” The lack of advertisements adds to the clean look of this site. It’s simple; the font is sans serif and easy to read, the spacing is utilized efficiently to group facts, there’s no clashing colors. I would give this site a score of 7 in terms of functionality and aesthetics. You can tell that this site isn’t old — it doesn’t have that “hasn’t been updated since the World Wide Web was created” look. You know, when there’s blurry graphics clashing with a colorful web page background, the font is usually serif, and it feels like you might download a virus if you aren’t careful. The reason why this particular site falls short\nfrom a 10 is the lack of originality. There’s not much to it. It’s nice that it’s to the point, but it looks boring. All facts are written in black font and the site’s background is white. The layout of this site also reflects this simplicity. Everything is perfectly symmetrical; all photos and facts are centered in the middle in one column. A lot of images were included in this page, which I found appealing because they were actually relevant to the facts (i.e., it wasn’t just fifteen photos of Oscar Wilde). Whenever there was a fact about a certain person, book, location, there was a corresponding photo provided. The writing on this page was around high-school level. The facts were well-written, grammatically correct, understandable. There was no writer bias; the person who wrote this article didn’t input her personal opinion of Wilde and kept things non-fiction, biographical.\nOverall, I think this site achieves its purpose in teaching others “15 things [they] may not know about Oscar Wilde.” Facts are provided in an organized manner, ensuring viewers may easily read them. Since Culture Trip is the one who put this page together, it would probably be beneficial to add more geographical facts. I mean, their purpose is to help people book travels, but what has that got to do with Oscar Wilde?? I guess there might be some fan out there that may want to visit the prison Wilde was at? Ultimately, in terms of providing information on Wilde, this page does the job. However, they do have a typo in the introduction that says “here are fourteen little-known facts regarding Oscar Wilde’s life and literary presence.” Fourteen.\n"

This site is trying to educate readers about the biography of Oscar Wilde, as well as some of the historical events surrounding him. It doesn’t seem to be aimed at a specific audience, but more so anyone who is interested in learning more about him. It reads very much like a Wikipedia biography. It does contain quite a few ads which take time to load and end up moving the page up and down as you’re trying to read, which is obnoxious. It has four sections, “Article,” “Quotes,” “Media,” and “Additional Info,” but I focused mainly on the “Article” section. After the first paragraph of the article, it has a drop-down menu with sections titled “What is Oscar Wilde known for?” “How did Oscar Wilde become famous?” and “How did Oscar Wilde die?” I found these questions interesting and I enjoyed reading about them. After this menu it continues as normal, detailing his biography, his works of literature, and the artistic movements occurring during his time, such as Aestheticism. I would rate this website a 3/10 on the aesthetically pleasing scale because while it does serve its purpose well and has a cohesive color scheme, it is very similar to a Wikipedia article. The layout of the main page is symmetrical and it is very easy to navigate, it is one main article with a few separate drop-down menu options as previously stated. On the right-hand side of the article, there is a “quick facts” column that has short bullet points stating basic Oscar Wilde facts which I found interesting and I thought it added to the readability of the article. There are a total of four images within the main article, three of which are black and white portraits and the other is a cartoon of Wilde. I guess the images are relevant as it is nice to see what he looked like, but there certainly could have been more variety, I think one portrait is plenty. The writing is very simple and straight-forward, again very similar to a Wikipedia article, simply stating fact after fact in order of Wilde’s timeline, it is clearly academic writing. I believe that the website achieves its goal to educate readers on Oscar Wilde’s biography, but it certainly could be more creative. I don’t think creativity is necessary when the goal is simply to inform, but this website leaves much to be desired in the aesthetically pleasing realm of website design. I think more color and more useful images would go a long way in improving this website, but if I was looking merely for biographical Oscar Wilde facts this website would be perfectly fine. \n"

It is not evident when the site was last updated.\n\nThe site aims to give the briefest introduction and summary of Oscar Wilde. There are no real ads, but there are a lot of links to related articles (they take up half, if not the majority of, the page). The site is put together quite similarly to a Wikipedia page, only the information is not half as extensive. I would give it a score of 2 or 3 for balance between functionality and aesthetics. There is not a lot going on here that will catch the eye beyond the choice of green as the site’s apparent “theme color.”\n\nThe design is asymmetrical. There are two columns informing us about Wilde. One is in actual paragraph format while the other displays his name, date of birth, date of death, etc. in “bullet point” style. Below this, there are several rows of related articles. These related articles aside, there is only one picture. Since it is a picture of Wilde, it is relevant, though not particularly eye-catching on its own. The site could benefit from a sketch of one of Wilde’s stories or something of the like.\n\nThe writing is in the informative style but very brief. The implied goal is to be informative about Wilde, but the page is all too brief and I would feel more informed if I had read Wilde’s Wikipedia page. The similarity in appearance--font, format, etc.--makes this feel like a lesser Wikipedia page in the end. The biggest improvement it could have would be more detail about Wilde, otherwise there does not appear to be a reason for someone researching him to come to this site out of all the possible options.\n'"

        "content": "The site I have chosen to evaluate is the American Literature website. To begin, I cannot immediately find any proof of recent updates. The site itself looks rather old and outdated. The site is rather simple with a plain, pale yellow background. Upon first impression, I would say the site is catering to the older generation. It is very straight forward and easy to navigate. The site has three small ads throughout the page, but they do not detract from the content and intention of the website. As I stated previously, the site is laid out very basically. It has categories for Wilde's novel, short stories, letters, plays, and even a section with a short biography. If you are looking to simply find out what Wilde wrote, and what it might be categorized as, this site should be appealing to you. However, in terms of aesthetics, it is lacking. I would score this website with a 3 out of 10. It does have a yellow background that adds color and it features a few photos of Oscar Wilde. The site also contains a handful of Wilde quotes, which I think is a nice touch. But in terms of beauty, it is lacking. The site is rather utilitarian in that it only really utilizes that which is useful. The website is divided by categories. On the left you can find the different types of writing that he did, divided by type of category IE letter, novel, etc. Each piece of writing that is listed also doubles as a link. When you click on the links they take you to a new page that has details about that specific piece of writing and also the characters. I do enjoy this feature as it makes it easy to learn more about Wilde's writings. The biography, quotes, and photos are on the right side of the page. The biography is written in simple paragraph form, with the photos being distributed throughout the writing. The biography begins with a few quotes, which I admit is a nice feature. The images on the page are appropriately selected and add an eye-grabbing aspect to the website. The largest photo is the famous image of Wilde holding his cane sitting in a chair, staring apathetically right at the viewer. There is also a quote/image farther down the page. In my opinion, the site could have benefited from more photos. The text on the website is straightforward and functional. The site avoids all pomp and flare, focusing solely on facts. My overall evaluation of this site would be less than satisfied. I feel the background definitely could have done with more color and drama. For a man that was known to strut around town with a green carnation in his lapel, I feel a website dedicated to him should offer a little more spunk than the Easter-yellow wallpaper had to offer.\n"

        "content": "This website is housed by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia’s public discourse  allows for open access editing of the page, thus there is not a singular, definite author - unlike Britancia’s page on Oscar Wilde. While there are some regulations in place, this accessible nature does backfire in the possible publication of inaccurate information (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia). This may also explain the recent update date of February 2nd, 2021. The site’s general policy is towards an ad-free experience, relying instead on consumer donations and fundraisers. \nThe site appears to be one of general interest, containing a mass of information relating to Oscar Wilde including: A comprehensive biography; a contextual review of his works from his journalistic beginnings to his final poem; a detailed account of his public trial and later imprisonment; a description of Wilde’s burial spot; and finally, his posthumous pardon, honors, and inclusion in numerous biographies (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde#Prose_writing:_1886–91). Its purpose agrees with Wikipedia’s overall intention as an open-access resource, thus its audience remains the digital community as a whole. However, considering the niche information contained it better suits an audience interested - or, at the very least, curious - towards Oscar Wilde as a historical figure. While readers could stumble across the site as part of a wiki-binge, it is more likely to attract viewership of purposeful readers. Wikipedia’s unreliable reputation could discourage advanced scholarship, so the site is better equipped as introductory reading on Oscar Wilde and other broad, informative purposes. Potential audiences might include students who are preparing to study Wilde in school for a week or two, but without serious academic consideration in mind at that time. \nIf I was to give this site’s layout a rating, I would give it a 5-6. In many ways, its asymmetric layout is predetermined by Wikipedia’s standard page formatting and thus serves a primarily utilitarian function. For example, the layout is broadly divided into two columns: a narrow, shaded column to the left with Wikipedia’s additional site tools - contents, other projects, language translations, etc. - and a wider, whitespace column to the right filled with black and hyperlinked text interrupted by section headers and images. The placement of images to the right or left of paragraphs and formatting of text around images encourages the reader’s eye towards said images. The various categories of images used adds to its aesthetics. The site includes not only images of Wilde himself but images relevant to its accompanying text, including: locations of interest, period caricatures of Wilde suggesting his contemporary status, ads, images of Wilde’s acquaintances, Beardsley’s illustrations for Wilde’s works, and evidence from Wilde’s trial. The inclusion of these images provides useful and thoroughly entertaining context to the text. The site’s ad-free space also contributes to its overall aesthetics, as one’s reading experience remains delightfully uninterrupted by disrupting ads - particularly those that interrupt mid-paragraph . However, the lack of strict boundaries - except for subject headings - can create a laborious, near endless reading experience. This experience is streamlined by the inclusion of a table of contents, which directs readers to particular sections of the text. Different types of writing might also be included, as the site is reserved solely to descriptive and some narrative information , with the occasional link to historical or creative pieces.  Overall, the site achieves its goal as an open-source resource while still attempting a certain level of aesthetic distinction. However, hyperlinks to Wilde’s works and outside links could be improved as they are solely functional. Embedded versions of external texts would no doubt add to the overall experience.\n"
